To make the demographic model realistic without overcomplicating it, the core dependencies capture how key life variables evolve over time and influence each other in predictable, well-documented ways. Age drives most life-course outcomes—like marital status, number of children, and employment—while education shapes income, which in turn determines tax burden. Names depend on age and gender because of generational naming trends. Together, these six dependencies reproduce the essential structure of human demographics: people age into and out of marriage, child-rearing, and work, while education and income shape their economic reality. Everything else—politics, religion, happiness, IQ—can be layered on later for added realism.

Age → Marital status
Age → Number of children
Age + Gender → Name
Age → Employment status
Age + Religion + Education → Politics
Education → Income
Income → Tax burden
