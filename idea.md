I watched a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEDXVGHW4Gg I Was Wrong about the Average American where John Green constructs the "average" American by looking at median demographic data. For example, there are more women than men, so the person is a woman. I'm wondering if I can recreate his analysis. Here are his data sources: Pew and Gallup provided all the political, religious, and other identity stuff: https://www.pewresearch.org/topics-categorized/ This is a good article on the federal income tax averages: https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/18/who-pays-and-doesnt-pay-federal-income-taxes-in-the-us/ But to understand state and local taxes, I found this helpful: https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-highest-lowest-tax-burden/20494 And the overall averages come from here: https://www.fool.com/taxes/how-much-does-the-average-american-pay-in-taxes/ I want to write a program that constructs the average/median American on the fly using data sources. It would also be cool if you could parameterize it. For a given year. For a given state. For a given political party. Etc.

I want to make a ruby project that ingests these data sources and then constructs the average American based on user parameters. The output could be a simple text description.
